This is the first (mainly test) version of qmobilempd. There is still a lot of code cleanup todo. But I think it works quite stable
at least for me at the moment.

The applications is licensed under terms for the GPLv3.

=INSTALL=

1. lrelease qmobilempd.pro
2. qmake
3. make

you should now have a runnable ./qmobilempd (at least if you are on linux with qt devel packages)
